A free analysis engine for the card game [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)).

What this engine can do:

* Model entire games of Skat, including Null and Grand games
* Find the best move in a given situation, knowing all cards
  * Does not work for Null games yet

What this engine can **not** do:
* Play _without_ knowing the opponents' cards

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently in development. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

üá©üá™/üá¨üáß While Skat is mostly played in Germany, this project is authored in English for better inclusiveness.

## How to use

Prerequisites:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)


Setup:

```bash
npm install
```

### UI

This package includes a prototype, which you can try out on

[https://thomasr.github.io/Skatalysator/ui/fullGameAnalysis/](https://thomasr.github.io/Skatalysator/ui/fullGameAnalysis/).


There is only one predefined game that can be analyzed.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This prototype is nowhere near finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Engine

Create a new Game:

```js
import { Game } from './engine/model/Game.mjs';
import { GameType } from './engine/model/GameType.mjs';

let distribution = {
  hands: [
    ['D7', 'SJ', 'H7', 'HQ', 'HK', 'S8', 'SK', 'SA', 'C8', 'CK'],
    ['DJ', 'DK', 'D9', 'C10', 'CQ', 'C9', 'C7', 'S9', 'S10', 'H10'],
    ['CJ', 'HJ', 'DA', 'D10', 'DQ', 'D8', 'CA', 'H8', 'HA', 'H9']
  ],
  skat: ['S7', 'SQ']
};

const game = new Game({
  distribution,
  gameType: GameType.DIAMONDS,
  currentPlayer: 1,
  soloPlayer: 2
});
```

Add moves that were played:

```js

// 1
game.playCard('C9');
game.playCard('CA');
game.playCard('C8');

// 2
game.playCard('CJ');
game.playCard('D7');
game.playCard('D9');

// 3
game.playCard('HJ');
game.playCard('SJ');
```

Inspect the game:

```js
console.log(game);
```

```text
-----
Game: Player 3 plays ‚ô¶
Pl.1: ‚ô£K ‚ô†A ‚ô†K ‚ô†8 ‚ô•K ‚ô•Q ‚ô•7
Pl.2: ‚ô¶J ‚ô¶K ‚ô£10 ‚ô£Q ‚ô£7 ‚ô†10 ‚ô†9 ‚ô•10
Pl.3: ‚ô¶A ‚ô¶10 ‚ô¶Q ‚ô¶8 ‚ô•A ‚ô•9 ‚ô•8
Skat: ‚ô†Q ‚ô†7
Table: ‚ô•J ‚ô†J --
Player 2 to move
Score: 16:0

History:
‚ô£9 ‚ô£A ‚ô£8
‚ô£J ‚ô¶7 ‚ô¶9
-----
```

Analyze the game:

```
import { SkatalysatorSearch } from './engine/analysis/RecursiveGameEvaluator.mjs';
console.log(new SkatalysatorSearch({ game }).minimax());
```

This will return the score that can be achieved with best play from the current position:

```text
78
```

You can aslo use `TrackingSkatalysatorSearch`, which will keep track of the optimal next move from this position,
but it is slower.

```
import { TrackingSkatalysatorSearch } from './engine/analysis/RecursiveGameEvaluator.mjs';

let searcher = new TrackingSkatalysatorSearch({ game });
console.log(searcher.minimax());
console.log(searcher.bestMoves);
```

```text
78
[ ‚ô¶K ]
```


#### Verbose logging

TODO: refactor the class hierarchy / create some factory

The `LoggingSkatalysatorSearch` constructor accepts a `logDepth` parameter if you want to inspect the internals:

```
new LoggingSkatalysatorSearch({ game, logDepth: 3 }).minimax();
```

```
Entering abSearch with Œ±=-Infinity, Œ≤=Infinity. minimizing‚Ä¶

      3 ‚ô•A is now best with score 37 > -Infinity.
      3 Examining ‚ô¶A with bounds [37, Infinity]

    2 Score: 62, Result: NONE
  1 Score: 62, Result: NONE

```

`logDepth` can take values up to 30, but this produces **a lot** of ouptut.
