# Skatalysator ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è

<img alt="Skatalysator logo" src="docs/3%20Jacks.png" style="width:142px;">

A free analysis engine for the game of [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)).

[**<img style="height: 3em;" src="docs/github-mark.svg" alt="github logo"> View on GitHub**](https://github.com/ThomasR/Skatalysator)

What this engine can do:

* Model entire games of Skat, including Null and Grand games
* Find the best move in a given situation, knowing all cards
  * Does not work for Null games yet

What this engine can **not** do:
* Play _without_ knowing the opponents' cards

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently in development. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

üá©üá™/üá¨üáß While Skat is mostly played in Germany, this project is authored in English for better inclusiveness.

## How to use

Prerequisites:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)


Setup:

```bash
npm install
```

### UI

This package includes a prototype, which you can try out on

[https://thomasr.github.io/Skatalysator/ui/fullGameAnalysis/prototype/game.html]().


It is currently available in German only. There is only one predefined game that can be analyzed.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This prototype is nowhere near finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Engine

Create a new Game:

```js
import { Game } from './engine/model/Game.mjs';
import { GameType } from './engine/model/GameType.mjs';

let distribution = {
  hands: [
    ['D7', 'SJ', 'H7', 'HQ', 'HK', 'S8', 'SK', 'SA', 'C8', 'CK'],
    ['DJ', 'DK', 'D9', 'C10', 'CQ', 'C9', 'C7', 'S9', 'S10', 'H10'],
    ['CJ', 'HJ', 'DA', 'D10', 'DQ', 'D8', 'CA', 'H8', 'HA', 'H9']
  ],
  skat: ['S7', 'SQ']
};

const game = new Game({
  distribution,
  gameType: GameType.DIAMONDS,
  currentPlayer: 1,
  soloPlayer: 2
});
```

Add moves that were played:

```js

// 1
game.playCard('C9');
game.playCard('CA');
game.playCard('C8');

// 2
game.playCard('CJ');
game.playCard('D7');
game.playCard('D9');

// 3
game.playCard('HJ');
game.playCard('SJ');
```

Inspect the game:

```js
console.log(game);
```

```text
-----
Game: Player 3 plays ‚ô¶
Pl.1: ‚ô£K ‚ô†A ‚ô†K ‚ô†8 ‚ô•K ‚ô•Q ‚ô•7
Pl.2: ‚ô¶J ‚ô¶K ‚ô£10 ‚ô£Q ‚ô£7 ‚ô†10 ‚ô†9 ‚ô•10
Pl.3: ‚ô¶A ‚ô¶10 ‚ô¶Q ‚ô¶8 ‚ô•A ‚ô•9 ‚ô•8

```

Analyze the game:

```
import { RecursiveGameEvaluator } from './engine/analysis/RecursiveGameEvaluator.mjs';
console.log(new RecursiveGameEvaluator({ game }).evaluateGame());
```

```text
{
  score: 75,
  moves: [
    ‚ô¶K, ‚ô•7, ‚ô•10, ‚ô•9, ‚ô¶J,
    ‚ô¶8, ‚ô†A, ‚ô£10, ‚ô•8, ‚ô£K,
    ‚ô£Q, ‚ô¶A, ‚ô†K
  ],
  forced: false,
  pointsSolo: 75,
  pointsDuo: 45
}
```
This returns the optimal move sequence for the rest of the game with `pointsSolo` and `pointsDuo` representing the
final score.

The `score` field is always equal to `pointsSolo`, except if one of the parties is black, in which case it equals `-1` or `121`
respectively.

If the current player has only one move alialable, `force` is set to `true`.

The returned object may also include a `hint` field, which currently can only take the value `'domination'`.
If this field is present, it means that the current player can enforce making all remaining points, and thus can
continue with open cards.

#### Verbose logging

The `RecursiveGameEvaluator` constructor also accepts a `logDepth` parameter if you want to inspect the internals:

```
console.log(new RecursiveGameEvaluator({ game, logDepth: 3 }).evaluateGame());
```

`logDepth` can take values up to 30, but this produces **a lot** of ouptut.
