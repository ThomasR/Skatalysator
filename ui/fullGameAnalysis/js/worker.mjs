/** Events sent to the main thread:
 * - `start`: Sent before analyzing a specific trick and card.
 *            Payload Example:
 *            {
 *              type: 'start',
 *              payload: {
 *                analyzedTrickIndex: 3,
 *                analyzedCardIndex: 1
 *              }
 *            }
 *
 * - `result`: Sent after analyzing a game state to report the score and suggested best moves.
 *             It may also include additional fields if a significant change occurred.
 *             Payload Example:
 *             {
 *               type: 'result',
 *               payload: {
 *                 analyzedTrickIndex: 3,

 *                 best: {
 *                   score: 100,
 *                   bestMoves: ['DQ', 'CA']
 *                 },
 *                 forfeitScore: 80, // Optional; only included if different from `score`
 *                 isBlunder: true // Optional; indicates a potential mistake in strategy
 *               }
 *             }
 *
 * - `timeout`: Sent when the analysis exceeds the given timeout. The worker stops processing.
 *              Payload Example:
 *              {
 *                type: 'timeout',
 *                payload: {
 *                  analyzedTrickIndex: 3,
 *                  analyzedCardIndex: 1
 *                }
 *              }
 *
 * - `end`: Sent when the analysis process is complete.
 *          Payload Example:
 *          {
 *            type: 'end'
 *          }
 *
 * @event start  Indicates that analysis has started for a trick and a card.
 * @event result Contains the computed score and suggested best moves for the current position.
 * @event timeout Reports that the analysis exceeded the allowed timeout and was halted.
 * @event end    Signals the completion of the analysis process.

/**
 * Handles messages received by the web worker to perform game analysis.
 * This function expects its input in the form of an object with specific properties.
 *
 * @param {Object} message - The input data object for analysis.
 * @param {Object} game - (Required) Serialized game data used to create a `Game` instance.
 *                        This object represents the current state of the game, including
 *                        played tricks, playersâ€™ moves, and the game board.
 *                        Example:
 *                        {
 *                          tricks: [],
 *                          currentTrick: ['card1', 'card2'],
 *                          score: 42,
 *                        }
 * @param {number[]} [skip=[]] - (Optional) An array of trick indices to skip during analysis.
 *                               If specified, the worker will not analyze these indices.
 *                               Example: [0, 2, 5] (skips tricks at positions 0, 2, and 5).
 * @param {number} [timeout=60] - (Optional) The timeout for analysis in seconds. If
 *                                 exceeded, the worker will send a timeout notification and
 *                                 terminate execution. Default is 60 seconds.
